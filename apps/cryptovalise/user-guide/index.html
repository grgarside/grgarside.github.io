			<h2>Coins</h2>
			<p>On opening the app, one is shown a <strong>list of coins</strong> that has been added by the user, with <strong>brief information</strong> about each coin: the common name of the coin, its symbol and logo, and the latest price information.</p>
			<p>The current market value for 1 coin is shown on the left, in USD on the USD trading market, and this USD value converted to GBP at the current exchange rate.</p>
			<p>Value over time is also presented for each coin, with the change in value for the past hour, day and week shown for each coin.</p>

			<h2>Add a coin</h2>
			<p>While viewing the coins added in the app, you can <strong>add a new coin</strong> by tapping the + button in the bottom-right on mobile and top-right on tablet.</p>
			<p>A list of available coins (coins which are not already in the list) is shown. Choose a coin from the list to add it to the saved coins. A message is shown if all the coins have been added and there are no others available.</p>
			<p>On adding a coin, a message is shown at the bottom of the screen and the list of coins is scrolled to the newly added coin. Tap Undo to remove the coin.</p>

			<h2>Coin price graph</h2>
			<p><strong>Tap on a coin card</strong> to view more details about a coin.</p>
			<p>At the top of the details is a graph showing the historical price for the coin. Initially, this shows the last 28 days history of the coin value in USD.</p>
			<p><img src="images/swipe.png" alt="Swipe" class="inline"> <strong>Swipe left and right</strong> on the graph to scroll the time period earlier and later. The vertical price axis automatically adjusts to keep the maximum and minimum values within the visible time period at the top and bottom of the graph.</p>
			<p><img src="images/tap.png" alt="Tap" class="inline"> <strong>Tap</strong> on the graph at a point to display the value at the point which was tapped. The closest date and time to your tapped location is selected, and the exact price at this point is displayed with the date and time in the lower-right of the graph. Axis are drawn on the graph at the tapped value which extend horizontally, and these are preserved as the graph is swiped left and right, which allows for easy comparison of prices across a greater time range.</p>
			<p><img src="images/pinch.png" alt="Pinch" class="inline"> <strong>Pinch</strong> on the graph to change the date range shown on the graph. Pinch in and out to decrease or increase the visible date range shown, up to a maximum of 1 year visible at a time.</p>
			<p><strong>Rotate the device to landscape</strong> to view the graph full screen.</p>

On mobile, this begins with a small card with the recent price information and deltas which was shown on the coin list. On tablet, this is not shown here since the coin card is still visible. The graph hides as the information is scrolled.</p>
			<p>Also available is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Current market capitalisation in USD, with the change in cap over the last 24h and the rank of the coin amongst all coins based on this market cap. Also shown is the available number of coins and the total supply if the coin has a limited total.</li>
