							</div>
							<p>What started as a day of skateboarding soon became a situation far more serious than Lion Kheswa, Y10, could have imagined.</p>
							<p>While using the ramps at the top of a multi story car park in the City Centre, Lion noticed a vulnerable lady sat alone at the edge of the car park. Realising this was potentially an urgent situation, Lion introduced himself to the lady and engaged her in conversation while he called the emergency services. Lion managed to stay focussed and keep the attention of the lady until support arrived and we are pleased to say that after further interaction the individual was safely taken in to the care of people that could help her.</p>
							<p>The bravery and compassion demonstrated by Lion is amazing, particularly for a student aged just 14yrs. We do not doubt that the outcome for the lady in question could well have been very different if it were not for the quick actions of Lion.</p>

							<p>There were only 6 teams from the whole of Cambridgeshire that made it to the U16 Boys County Hockey Tournament Finals and it was always going to be tough for our boys, the majority of whom are still in Y10. It was no surprise that we lost to The Perse, Cambridge but the really big result was against Kimbolton where we performed well above expectation & drew 1-1 with a goal from Janas. The boys put in a great performance only missing out on qualifying through goal difference. Well done boys.</p>

							<p>The tournament did not start well with the last minute loss of our goalkeeper, but luckily Bartosz Bere (Y8) stepped in at the last minute. The teams played in a round robin tournament and it soon became clear that our main challengers were going to be Jack Hunt who had a Y9 player bigger than Mr German. The boys played some of the best football from any TDA team for quite some time which resulted in them winning the competition without conceding a single goal. What a great achievement.</p>

In addition to the conference students received a tour of Harvard University and watched a local basketball match. This sounds like a fantastic opportunity for our future scientists.</p>

The event consisted of several Christmas carols along with readings from each primary school with many added props in order to make each performance that much more personal and interesting from an audience’s point of view. The evening also included performances from the TDA Woodwind Ensemble, TDA Brass ensemble and 3 solo performances from the TDA Y12/13 Music students; Katie Baca on Violin, Lewis Shaw on Tenor Sax and Harry Carter on Classical Guitar. As a whole the night was a Christmas-filled celebration in the vast and stunning space of the Cathedral.</p>

							<p>The U14 hockey girls played against Kimbolton A team in a fixture and while this was a tough ask against an established team it was good practice for the County Tournament. With a quick set of Kimbolton forwards the girls were unable to hold off the opposition but strong defence from Ellie Ward kept Kimbolton under control to keep the opponents score down. Well done Ellie!</p>

							<p>The senior netball team attended the County Tournament in Cambridge and did exceptionally well against teams that were made up of older players. TDA  nished in 6th place on the day after winning four games, drawing one game and losing four games. It was a well contested tournament with a high standard of play and after losing out to 4th place by just three points the girls will be returning next year to compete for a place in the top two.</p>

							<p>Y7 finished full and extra time on a draw of 4:4, taking the game to penalties. At the end of the penalty round the scores were still tied resulting in sudden death penalties. TDA held their nerve and, with some outstanding goal keeping and impressive finishing, we won the game.</p>
							<p>Y8 were not giving in easily either with the score at 2:2 with one minute left in the game. Aurimas Sulga secured the win with a goal in the 90th minute taking the team through to the next round.</p>
							<p>Y9 were drawing 2:2 at the end of full time and following an exciting period of extra time where a further five goals were scored we were beaten 5:4. The Y9 team now go through to the plate competition where they will play the losing team between Ormiston Bush eld Academy and Neale Wade.</p>
							<p>The Y11 team fought back from going behind early in the game to win comfortably by 4 goals to 2, with all four goals coming from Filip Czerwonka, well done Filip! Y11 team now progress to the next round of the cup.</p>

							</div>
							<p>Following the summer break the Duke of Edinburgh programme was up and running almost as soon as we had returned to the Academy. The D of E staff team spent September and October with students undertaking varying levels of training in preparation for the full expeditions in 2017.</p>
							<p>Following a change in eligibility criteria, Y9 were able to participate in the awards scheme for the first time, making this a particularly busy year. Over two consecutive weekends 50 Y9 and 50 Y10 students hiked approximately 13km and 24km, respectively, across the Rutland countryside, learning the basic skills of camp craft.</p>
							<p>The following week, 28 Y11 students spent three days in Edale, during which time they trekked across the more dif cult terrain of the Peak District, for a total of 20hrs, carrying all the equipment required for outdoor survival in the process.</p>
							<p>As we entered October, 16 Y13 students started their training exercise for the gold award. The students spent four days in the Yorkshire Dales trekking and camping independently, embedding the knowledge learned in the bronze and silver awards.</p>
							<p>The D of E training was rounded off with a 2020 training expedition, which allowed 15 students in Y12 the opportunity to begin their awards journey, on a two day hike across the Lincolnshire countryside.</p>
							<p>We are looking forward to working with the students on their official award expeditions in 2017.</p>

							<p>The Smallpeice Trust visited the Academy to deliver a STEM water filtration day to Y8. Students were given the instructions, tools and resources to design and build a working water filter. Working in teams, students were assigned tasks to ensure that the cost of their design was monitored, marketing materials were produced to promote the design and a presentation was prepared for delivery to the panel at the end of the challenge. The students were fully engaged in this interactive session, demonstrating the benefits of learning beyond the classroom.</p>

							</div>
							<p>Medical Mavericks spent a day at TDA in October to bring the world of medical science to the classroom.</p>
							<p>Y9 students were able to explore a variety of areas of the medical industry through the technologies used in hospitals. Throughout the sessions students were able to move freely between medical stations using the range of equipment to test and take recordings of themselves, such as their blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen levels and lung capacity. In addition to this students were able to try their hand at key hole surgery, taking blood from Andy the Arm and intubating Eddy the Head.</p>
							<p>To finish the day the Medical Mavericks team delivered a show to STEM Ambassadors to explore careers in medicine and engineering in the medical industry before delivering the ‘Human Guinea Pig’, an interactive session looking at medical techniques such as retina displays and endoscopy.</p>

							<div class="flex-info"><h4>Lead Learners</h4></div>
							<p>Lead Learners is a scheme that enables students to develop their leadership skills while supporting the Academy and other students.</p>
							<p>Students are able to align their particular strengths and interests with their leadership ability by opting to be a Lead Learner in an area that appeals to them. Each role has a job description and students are expected to complete an application form describing why they believe they are suitable for the role.</p>
							<p>When the students returned to the Academy in September they were invited to apply for roles and following a short selection process students were notified of the outcome of their application before the half term. The Lead Learners will commence with their respective duties in November and we will be following their progress so look out for updates in future newsletters, on the website and on social media.</p>
