				<h2>Staff ICT Code of Conduct and Acceptable Use Policy</h2>
				<p>ICT and the related technologies such as e-mail, the internet and mobile devices are an expected part of our daily working life at the Thomas Deacon Academy. This policy is designed to ensure that all staff, casual workers, Board members, volunteers and external partners are aware of their professional responsibilities when using any form of ICT provided by or linked to the Academy.

				<h2>Student Code of Conduct for ICT</h2>
				<h3>Rationale</h3>
				<p>It is important to communicate to students simple and clear expectations about appropriate use of the Academy’s computer facilities. The increasing use of ICT in education, training & employment means that students should train themselves in the responsible use of ICT systems.</p>
				<h3>Guidelines</h3>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Network Access Account</strong>
						<p>Each student is provided with a unique login name which is password protected. Whilst logged in the student must take precautions that no other person uses their terminal. Each student is responsible for any access to the network using their login name and so must keep their password secret. Any misuse that occurs under a login will result in disciplinary action being taken against that student.</p></li>
					<li><strong>Document Storage</strong>
						<p>Each student is provided with enough storage for their coursework. Personal documents including, but not limited to, images, videos, games, audio files etc should not be stored here. Students should practise good housekeeping in order to keep space usage to a minimum. Images within Microsoft Office documents should always be compressed to WEB quality to preserve space. If a student requires additional storage for their coursework they should forward a request to the IT Service Desk with details of which subject and teacher.</p></li>
					<li><strong>Internet</strong>
						<p>This is provided as an educational tool for student research. Undesirable sites have mostly been blocked but this is an ongoing process. If one is discovered by accident it must be reported to IT Service Desk who will block it. Any student who knowingly gains access to an undesirable site or bypasses a block to access a site will face disciplinary action.</p></li>
					<li><strong>Computer Games</strong>
						<p>There may be times when a teacher will authorise the use of educational games for academic purposes, but besides these occasions no computer game playing is permitted in the Academy. Students found playing computer games will face disciplinary action.</p></li>
					<li><strong>E-mail</strong>
						<p>Student e-mail is provided as an aid to learning. Any student who abuses this facility will face disciplinary action.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Keep your mailbox tidy. Delete any e-mails and attachments that are no longer required.</li>
							<li>Make sure that only the intended recipients are present in the To and Cc boxes.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>E-mail Abuse</strong>
						<p>If received, such e-mails should be reported to a member of staff. Abuse includes:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Sending or forwarding e-mails containing libelous, defamatory, offensive, racist or obscene content such as bad language, threats, insults etc. or anything that can be construed as bullying.</li>
							<li>Sending mass e-mails or forwarding chain letters.</li>
							<li>Sending games, game links or other inappropriate subject matter.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Password</strong>
						<p>Passwords are supplied to enable you to keep your data safe and to protect your reputation. Giving your password to someone else exposes both your data and your reputation to risk. So: protect your password and use passwords that are not easy for others to guess.</p></li>
					<li><strong>Disciplinary Action</strong>
						<p>Any abuse of computer facilities will result in a negative event for the student being recorded on ePortal. It may also result in the student having their network account disabled. Serious breaches of this code of conduct could result in more extensive consequences in line with the academy’s Behaviour Management Policy, including the possibility of exclusion from the Academy.</p></li>
