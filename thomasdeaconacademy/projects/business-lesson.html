				<h2>Transcript</h2>
				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>Just have a look through your ideas, which ones you think are good, and do what you normally do. You've missed a few lessons Stefan — we need to find a way of catching up with you: intervention. Have you had a chance to pick one of your three business ideas? You've not been checking your emails?</p>
				<p>It's not quite quarter-to so we'll wait a little while. Thanks for making it on time, register please.</p>
				<h3>Presentations</h3>
				<p>Who's presenting today then? Pick one out of the cup. The only person really that can't present because you've had a bit of absence is yourself Stefan, but if you want to at least get some ideas.</p>
				<p>What's the difference Hassan? Revenue is how much money you have and profit is how much money you make. Almost, revenue is how much money you'll have in your till, if you like. There's cookies with different designs: flower, rose. So if you wanted to do that you could have cookies that would be more appealing to females and cookies that would be more appealing to males.<br>
					Signature; signed posters that you could potentially use. You could you a famous quote the person's said, that people could use as motivation.<br>
					I'm not paying for it, I'm just getting it. You're going to get the stock on credit, which means you don't have to pay for it until you've sold it.<br>
					Cupcakes or milkshakes? Milkshakes, so you're going to have a bit of competition!<br>
					You're not going to buy them individually, are you? You're going to buy a bag of 20, or 30, or 50, and then cook them at home.<br>
					Are you going to provide any sauces with them like you've got in your pictures? Yes. Have you thought about whether they're going to be meat or vegetarian?</p>
				<h3>Writing</h3>
				<p>For the last 15 minutes, everyone knows who their pair is? I want you to set up a Word document. Use the title "the selected idea", that's the file name. It needs to go into your Unit 3/4 folder, and you need to write 2 to 3 sentences on why you chose that particular idea. Remember, this is the one that you're both going to be working on, as a pair. You need to write some notes on the back of your sheet, because even though you're working as a pair, your evidence needs to be clearly separate.</p>
				<h3>End</h3>
				<p>Someone wants to take responsibility for this row, please? Thank you. Just tuck that chair underneath please Stefan. On Friday we'll be looking at aims and objectives, so if you get a chance do some background reading, maybe look in a book, there's loads of books in the library under 634. If you can photocopy a page from a textbook that's about aims and objectives, you get an achievement point, or if you do it from the internet. That's what we're looking at on Friday. Good. Good lesson, lead out.</p>
